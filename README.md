following the [ClojureBridge Workshop Material](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/drawing/blob/master/curriculum/first-program.md) and playing around with Quil!

A project using [Quil](http://quil.info) in which you have:
* a Rectangle 
  * that changes color with the position of the mouse
  * is connected to the edges of the screen by lines
